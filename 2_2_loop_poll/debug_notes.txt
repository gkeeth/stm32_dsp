- set up for codec
- hooks attached but not connected to logic analyzer, including ground and o-scope probes
- sends address
- stalls during first i2c_transfer7 at i2c_common_v1.c:483
    while (!(I2C_SR1(i2c) & I2C_SR1_ADDR));
    // address is never sent
    // NOTE: ADDR is not set after a nack reception, per HRM


works with: d3 attached to pe10 and d1 or d2 attached to sda and empty hook on scl
detaching d3 breaks it (d1 still attached to sda, and empty hook on scl)
    not true, just stops triggering
attaching d1 or d2 to scl breaks it (d1 still attached to sda, and d3 still attached to pe10)
detaching everything from scl/sda breaks it
jiggling hooks breaks it

BNC adapter wired to DUT, BNC adapter disconnected from ADALM
- still breaks when attaching second I2C logic probe

set gpio output options GPIO_OSPEED_100MHZ?
- tried 100MHz, 50MHz, 2MHz: no change
also try enabling pullup (as seen in waveshare demo code?)
- no change

Wire harness connected to DUT, wire harness disconnected from ADALM/BNC board
- still breaks when attaching second i2c logic probe

any random wire touching second i2c pin
- breaks if you try hard enough

try different I2C pins?
- tried PB10/PB11 (I2C2), same result

Try with ground lead from wiring harness disconnected
- still breaks

try with ssd1306 display instead of codec
- can't seem to provoke issue -> is the issue with the codec board?

Try making a soldered board
- didn't fix it

# THINGS TO TRY

Try temperature sensor with stm32f407

Try ssd1306 with stm32f0
    worked

Try ssd1306 again with stm32f407
    worked (should try again with actual ssd1306 demo program)

Try codec with stm32f0
    worked

try with stm32f4 powered by wall wart

try with stm32f4 powered by usb battery
- with jlink & logic analyzer connected: seems to work reliably (can't get it to fail)

try with debugger detached (flash board, detach debugger, try to use logic analyzer)
- with stm32f4 powered by usb: works sometimes

try with usb isolator

break up i2c functions into component parts
