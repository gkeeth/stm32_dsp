== Input signal path
single-ended microphone inputs:
- mic signal to LINPUT1 or RINPUT1
- internal non-inverting input of input PGA switched to VMID

gain of mic PGAs controlled by software or ALC/limiter. When ALC is used, gain
should not be set manually. When ALC is not used, gain is set with LINVOL[5:0]
and RINVOL[5:0]

input PGAs & boost mixers enabled by AINL and AINR register bits




== CONFIGURATION STEPS
- enable L/R input PGAs
  - AINL/AINR/LMIC/RMIC = 1
- set single-ended mic input L/R
  - LMN1/RMN1 = 1 (LINPUT1/RINPUT1 to PGA inverting input)
  - LMP2/LMP3/RMP2/RMP3 = 0 (disconnect L/RINPUT2/3 from PGA, connect PGA +input to VMID)
  - LMIC2B/RMIC2B = 1 (connect input PGAs to boost mixer)
- enable zero cross detector (optional, to change gain only at zero crossings)
  - LIZC/RIZC = 0
  - TOEN = 1 (optional, for zero-crossing timeout)
  - TOCLKSEL = 0 or 1 (optional, for zero-crossing timeout. 0 = slower, 1 = faster)
- set input PGA volume (if not using ALC)
  - LINVOL[5:0]/RINVOL[5:0]
  - IPVU = 1 (gains not updated until IPVU written, can be IPVU bit in L or R register)
- enable ALC (if not using manual volume)
  - ??
- unmute
  - LINMUTE/RINMUTE = 0

  - ADCPOL[1:0]: 00 = no inversion, 01 = L inverted, 10 = R inverted, 11 = both inverted
  - DATSEL[1:0]: 00 = no swap, 01 = right data comes from left ADC, 10 = left data comes from right ADC, 11 = both channels swapped
- set digital (ADC) volume
  - LADCVOL[7:0]/RADCVOL[7:0]: 0x00 = digital mute, 0xFF = +30dB in 0.5dB steps
  - ADCVU to update L & R gains

  - DACVU: update L/R dac volume control
- DAC soft mute
  - DACMU = 1 for muted via digital soft mute (need to set to 0 for audio!)
  - DACSMM: soft mute mode. 0 = volume will ramp immediately when disabling DACMU. 1 = volume will ramp slowly
  - DACMR: mute rate. 0 = fast ramp, 1 = slow ramp
- DAC de-emphasis (don't enable)
  - DEEMPH[1:0]: 00 - disabled
- DAC output phase & mixing - default is fine

    - SPKVU: speaker volume update
    - SPKLZC/SPKRZC: zero cross detector enable

  - enable outputs
    - LOUT1/ROUT1 = 1: enable headphone outputs

    - SPK_OP_EN[1:0] = 11: enable speaker outputs
        NOTE: SYSCLK must be active, and DCLKDIV should be set for a classD clock between 700kHz and 800kHz
- speaker clocking
  - set DCLKDIV to give proper class D clock relative to SYSCLK
  - set SPK_OP_EN[1:0] to enable speaker outputs
- thermal shutdown
  - TSDEN = 1 to enable thermal shutdown (default)

  - class d clock: between 700kHz and 800kHz: DCLKDIV = 0b111 (div by 16)
